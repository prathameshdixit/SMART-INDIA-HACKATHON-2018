After Death Care- (An application developed to provide mortuary vans for after death services.) 

Submitted to Ministry: Ministry of Health & Family Welfare

Problem: Mortuary Vans are largely not available across states and it becomes extremely disappointing if the vans are not available
to take dead bodies from hospitals to their respective homes. Though there are vans which are available in private space however
there is no single point of contact through which services of these vans could be requested when in need. Hence it is of dire need 
to develop an application which can act as a common platform for the people who need the services of mortuary vans during the
emergency as well as the mortuary van owners to have a common platform where it will be easy and also feasible for both the parties
to contact.

Introduction: In a country like India which has huge numbers of population it is very difficult to manage the amounts of dead bodies
in the government as well as the private hospitals with so many number of people having last breaths here.It becomes a very hectic
task of managing the dead bodies in the country. With so many numbers of such bodies it gives an obvious rise to problems such as 
lack of space in mortgages to store bodies, non easy identification of bodies and may even lead to very serious problems such as 
organ trafficking, bodies getting rotten and may and many more such problems.Hence there is need to understand that an immediate 
solution is to be presented to this Problem and is done by our team by presenting an application which will give a direct point of
contact for both the service seekers and the providers. The following project can be divided as given

Interface for the users: 
It includes a simple interface which will be required for the people who want to contact the vans for services.It includes the designing
of application with simple and user understandable interface which may not hinder the user during the time of emergency. The app is also
provided with the features of use of multiple Indian languages so that the people hailing from rural and lesser literate part of the
society can have an access to it.

Interface with SHG’s:
The application will also have access allowed for the Self help groups as well as the NGO’s where in the identification and help to the
corpse’s family will be quick and easy.
Interface with authorities:
1.	The interface will have feeds queries and help requests sent to them by the users.
2.	When the request regarding the mortuary vans is placed the authorities will have an authentication check and will be able to respond 
to the  query.
3.	For this the government should initiate a few tie ups with the private hospitals as well as the NGO copse vans.
4.	A very convenient use of the Google maps can be done by inheriting the Google APIs wherein the closest availability of a van and live
tracking of vans can be done by both users and the authorities.
5.	For financially backward people, the government can bear the cost or can give a relief on the expense by linking their adhar card 
(UIDs) with the details of corpse’s tracking.
6.	For people hailing from a very remote location, a centralized helpline will be generated
